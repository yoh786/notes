I don't really know why this file is here but we will go with it.

	look at this guy, trying to non paragraph carriage return...

So anyhow, about linux. how many ways can a 4 bit processor be organized; without pallindromes?

	- palindromes exist like 1100 and 0011; they are just mirrors of each other. They do not exhibit chirality?

	- Now this is a real mess, i count NINE values... wtf... q.q

	- total i suppose there are (14), so how the eff do you get 14
	  out of binary set of 4 first of all, and how do you lose 5
	  to being non palindromes. at least 9 is closed to eight and
	  that's the only number i was actually planning on getting;
	  oh and 12 for some reason.

	- SO HERES THE FUN PART: when you look it up online there are
	  SIXTEEN possible values that can be represented by a 4 bit
	  processor, and the thing is: it makes sense; that's what i
	  wanted. But I can't still square why: except experimentally.
	  I mean mathematically it makes sense as a 2 to the whatever
	  power. OHHHHH thats why the answer to how many combinations
	  of N (patterns) is equal to twice the number of combinations
	  (patterns) of N-1.

	- wait I figured it out: You're just stupid, when you add a
	  binary digit on, your essentially doubling every combination
	  that existed before because you are giving a different
	  (head)er to the same (foot)er. Now we have mind blown...

	- BONUS POINTS:** A group of 4 bits is called a nibble; a group of 8 bits is called a BITE **



THE UNIX PHILOSOPHY
======================
  "Small is beautiful"

	The main idea (design factors) behind UNIX were to create a
	simple, elegant, and easy-to-use operating system and
	supporting software. 

	- Make each program do one thing well. These simple programs
	  are called tools.

	- Expect the output of every program to become the input of
	  another, yet unknown, program. This means that simple tools
	  can be connected to do complex jobs.

	- Don't hesitate to build new programs to do a job. The
	  library of tools keeps increasing.


WHAT DOES A COMPUTER DO?
========================

	I'm going to take a few liberties here and translate this into
	what a *modern* day computer sees as 'words' he is using in
	this book.

	- Manipulate Data: The computer is a blank electronic
	  brain/canvas that holds and calculates data for you
	  (working-memory).

	- File data: A computer can remember, not just ideas but also
	  personal history (short-term memory).

	- Communicate: with other computers and in turn, other people.

	- Database: (bonus) perhaps totally independent I'm not sure.
	  Long-term memory with an index. Holds everything, ever.
