Abstract

- AWS cloud provides a broad set of infrastructure services
+ computing power 
+ storage options
+ networking
+ databases
  * Delivered as a utility: on demand, pay as you go.
  * Goal is to allow smaller groups to utilize the building blocks they need to respond quickly to changing business requirements. This whitepaper goes into the different services that make up the platform.

INTRO
----
Amazon starting offering cloud computing services in 2006, these were IT infrastructure services in the form of web services. Today AWS provides a highly reliable, low-cost infrastructure platform in the cloud that powers thousands of businesses in 190 countries across the globe.

What is Cloud Computing?
- the on demand delivery of computer power, db storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the internet with pay as you go pricing. Provides rapid access to flexible and low cost IT resources 


6 ADVANTAGES OF CLOUD COMPUTING
-------------------------------

1. Trade capital expense for variable expense: You do not have t oinvest heavily in data centers. Just pay for what you need and what you consume.

2. Benefit from massive economies of scale.

3. Stop guessing about capacity and infrastructure needs: Making decisions beforehand leads to expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity.

4. Increase speed and agility: new resources are just a click away.

5. Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers: focus on projects that differentiate your business, not the infrastructure.

6. Go global in minutes: deploy app in multiple regions around the world in just a few clicks. 


TYPES OF CLOUD COMPUTING
-----------------------

- Infrastructure as a service  

- Platform as a service

- Software as a service


CLOUD COMPUTING MODELS
-----------------------

- Cloud: fully deployed in the cloud, all parts of the application run in the cloud.

- Hybrid: way to connect infrastructure and apps between cloud based resources and those not in the cloud.

- On Premisis: sometimes called "private cloud". use virtualization and resource management tools to deploy resources locally. most models similar to traditional IT infrastructure while expanding avail resources.

GLOBAL INFRASTUCTURE
------------------------
- Amazon doesnt use one big data center

- rather they have local (AZ's) or availability zones. consist of one or more data centers with redundant power for region.
